# 📬 Personal Chat Application

This is a **personal experimental project** where I challenge myself to build a chat application **from scratch** using **Next.js** for the frontend and **NestJS** for the backend. The project is a result of my passion for learning through hands-on experimentation, starting from the initial design phase to development and testing.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a simple, yet feature-rich, chat application that allows users to send and receive messages in real-time. The design is heavily inspired by the [Chateo UI Kit](<https://www.figma.com/design/AM1dXNHHl5T93ku1RVKV3t/Chateo-UI-Kit---Messenger-App-(Community)?node-id=1-153&t=ZMofdcU82sADGEVg-0>) available on Figma. I found the design clean, modern, and a perfect fit for my learning goals.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) — for server-side rendering and seamless API integration.
- **Backend**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) — for creating a robust, maintainable server-side application.
